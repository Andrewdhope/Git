INIT and CLONE:

> If you initialize in GitHub with a README, then you'll need to clone it, not initialize locally and push it

FETCH, MERGE, and PULL:
	git fetch origin

> Pull is just fetch plus merge in one step
	
PUSH:
	git push <remote> <branch>
	
> default remote is origin and default branch is master
> use -n to execute as a dry-run

REMOTE:
	git remote add <name> <url>
	
> when you clone a repo, it automatically creates a remote called origin
> -v to view remotes

COMMIT:
	git commit -m "comment"
